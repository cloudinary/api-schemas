## Tools

### üîç MCP Operations Viewer

An advanced web-based tool for analyzing and visualizing MCP (Model Context Protocol) operations from OpenAPI schemas.

**üëâ [Launch MCP Operations Viewer](https://cloudinary.github.io/api-schemas/mcp-operations-viewer.html)**

#### Features

- **Schema Selection**: Choose from predefined Cloudinary API schemas or upload your own OpenAPI YAML files
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: View detailed information about each API operation including:
  - Operation ID and HTTP method
  - MCP tool names and scopes
  - API summaries and descriptions
  - MCP-specific descriptions
  - Missing MCP configuration detection
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter operations by category, tool name, scopes, HTTP method, or MCP status
- **Data Export**: Export analysis results to CSV format
- **Interactive Table**: Sortable, searchable DataTable with hover tooltips for long content
- **Real-time Statistics**: Summary cards showing total operations, MCP coverage, and category counts
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

#### Usage

1. **Select a Schema**: Click on one of the predefined schema tabs (Assets, Config, Analysis, etc.) or upload your own YAML file
2. **Analyze Operations**: The table will populate with all API operations and their MCP configurations
3. **Filter Results**: Use the filter dropdowns to narrow down operations by specific criteria
4. **Export Data**: Click the "Export Data" button to download results as CSV
5. **Examine Details**: Hover over cells to see full content for truncated text

#### Technical Details

- **Framework**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Bootstrap 5 for styling
- **Data Processing**: Uses js-yaml library for YAML parsing
- **Table Management**: DataTables library for advanced table functionality
- **File Support**: Accepts `.yml` and `.yaml` files
- **Browser Compatibility**: Modern browsers with ES6+ support

#### Configuration

The tool automatically loads schemas listed in `schemas.yml`. To add new schemas:

1. Create a new directory with your schema name
2. Add a `schema.yml` file containing your OpenAPI specification
3. Update `schemas.yml` to include your new schema directory
4. The tool will automatically discover and display your schema
