      summary: Uploads media assets (images, videos, raw files) to your Cloudinary product environment
      description: |
        Uploads media assets (images, videos, raw files) to your Cloudinary product environment. The file is securely stored
        in the cloud with backup and revision history. Cloudinary automatically analyzes and saves important data about each
        asset, such as format, size, resolution, and prominent colors, which is indexed to enable searching on those attributes.

        Supports uploading from:
        - Local file paths (SDKs/MCP server only). For MCP server path MUST start with file://
        - Remote HTTP/HTTPS URLs
        - Base64 Data URIs (max ~60 MB)
        - Private storage buckets (S3 or Google Storage)
        - FTP addresses

        The uploaded asset is immediately available for transformation and delivery upon successful upload.

        Transform media files using transformation syntax in delivery URLs, which creates derived files accessible immediately without re-uploading the original.

      summary: Upload a single chunk of a large file
      description: |
        Uploads a single chunk of a large file as part of a chunked upload process. This enables efficient upload of
        large files with the ability to resume interrupted uploads. Each request uploads one chunk of the file.
        It is required for any files that are larger than 100 MB. This is often relevant for video files, as they
        tend to have larger file sizes. Minimum chunk size is 5 MB.

        Returns a list of resources matching the specified search criteria.

        Uses Lucene-like query language to search by descriptive attributes (public_id, filename, folder, tags, context), file details (resource_type, format, bytes, width, height), embedded data (image_metadata), and analyzed data (face_count, colors, quality_score). Supports aggregate counts and complex Boolean expressions.

            Name of an upload preset that you defined for your Cloudinary product environment. An upload preset consists of upload parameters centrally managed using the Admin API or from the Upload Presets page of the Console Settings. An upload preset may be marked as unsigned, which allows unsigned uploading directly from the browser and restricts the optional parameters to: public_id, folder, tags, context, face_coordinates, regions and custom_coordinates.
